# Tales and Legends
It's a Dark Fantasy RPG system born in [PBF game](http://www.tal.webd.pl) that you will probably not interested in because it's entirely written in Polish. But... It's made in [SILE](http://www.sile-typesetter.org/). XML flavor with a little of tweaks and totally custom class gives you a good use-case you can study.
